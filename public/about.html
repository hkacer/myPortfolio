  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hi, my name is Hatice Kaymaz and I am a highly motivated and enthusiastic software developer. I am always seeking out new challenges and am eager to learn and grow as a professional. I have strong communication skills and am able to work effectively in both team and solo environments. I am confident in my abilities and have high self-esteem, which allows me to approach each new project with a positive attitude.

    In my past experiences, I have gained a diverse set of skills in a variety of programming languages and technologies. I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and am committed to staying up to date with the latest developments in my field.
    
    In my free time, I enjoy watching Korean-Dramas,  and am always looking for new ways to stay active and engaged.
    
    I am excited to share my portfolio with you and hope that it will give you a sense of my skills and capabilities as a software developer. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential opportunities.</p>
